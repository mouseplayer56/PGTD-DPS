# PGTD-DPS
### Calculate the DPS of towers in Pixel Gun Tower Defense (Roblox Game)!

Yes, even though the game is long-dead because the group got removed for _???_, this acts as a basic resource for calculating DPS with weapon and character combos. I worked on this in June, but if it's highly sought-after I might update it with more features.

This was made to be used alongside the wiki, hence you're asked to enter the data values for damage, range, etc. in an order that aligns with the wiki's layout of presenting this information.

**Possible TO-DOs:**
- Scrape data off the wiki instead of asking the user for the data; this would increase the ease-of-use of the program, requiring only a name.
- Have support for min-max damage values, in the case of explosive weapons that deal damage to multiple enemies.
- Simulate different waves/maps to calculate tower DPS and determine the best tower/weapon combos to use in certain waves.

_**Requires Python 3.10 or higher.**_
